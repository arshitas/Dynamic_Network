# Dynamic Network Simulation 

### Aim
A network consists of 7 nodes n0-n6 connected in ring topology. Each link is a duplex connection of 10Mbps bandwidth and 10ms latency. Data packets need to be transferred from node n0 to node n3 taking the shortest path. This is a dynamic network where the routing adjusts to link failures as node n2 goes in `sleep mode`.
